# Mump


Mumpis a mobile application which enables the user to listen music either via what one likes, or via one's location.
In brief, as long as you're walking in the city, Mump decides what should you listen according to what has been listened by others where you are.

# Precisions

Please be keen on the way this application has been made technically speaking. The whole application (design included) was made by one person only (me) in less than 12 hours in one day. It's just a proof of concept made for educational purposes.
